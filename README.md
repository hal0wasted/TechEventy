# TechEventy
TechEventy is a web application built with Spring MVC, Hibernate and MySQL.  The application provides a single place for technological events in different categories such as competitions in sphere of IT, conferences, hackathons, etc. It also provides an information about organisers of events and thus offers a better interaction for users with the essence of the event and the people or organisations that stand behind. The application solves the problem of other sites that show events only for one type of category (conferences only or IT competitions only) with no relevant information about events’ organisers.  It offers a comparison of organisers by the number of created event – the users can view organisations/people that are the most active in this sphere.  TechEventy gives the opportunity for every user to create a registration, add her/his own event with all the meaningful information that potential visitors may want to have.
